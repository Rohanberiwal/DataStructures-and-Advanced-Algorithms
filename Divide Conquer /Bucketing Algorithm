 "bucketing" is a technique that involves dividing a range of values into smaller intervals or "buckets"
and then distributing the elements into these buckets based on certain criteria. This technique is
often used to solve problems more efficiently by reducing the search space or grouping similar elements together.

Working  :
Divide the Range: Identify the range of possible values in the input data.

Create Buckets: Divide the range into smaller intervals or buckets.

Distribute Elements: Place each element into the corresponding bucket based on its value or some specific property.

Process Buckets: Perform operations or computations on each bucket separately.

Bucketing is commonly used in various algorithms, such as sorting algorithms, data distribution strategies, and
optimization techniques. It's particularly useful when the input data has a known range, and you can exploit 
that knowledge to simplify the problem.

One popular example of bucketing is in the Bucket Sort algorithm, where elements are distributed into different buckets, 
each bucket is sorted individually, and then the sorted buckets are concatenated to obtain the final sorted array.
