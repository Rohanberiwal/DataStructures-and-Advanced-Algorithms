Divide and Conquer : 
Convex HuLL and median finding 

Classic algorhitm for the divivde and conquer : Merge sort , convex hull . 

Paradigm :  Given a problem of size n that has to be divide and then compution for that has to be done , the problem set then has to be merged to get the final answer . 

The size of the problem may be "a" a>1 and the divivoson of each problem is n/b where b>1(strict comparsion) .Then the problem is solved recursively .
Master theorm and the recurrance relation has to be written , accordingly .


T(n) = a*(T(n/b))  + [work that has to done for the merge operation ] .


Convex HULL : Divide and conquer 
The convex hull is the problem where there are some of the points in the space and the we have to conevr the points and make a figure using all the point and there may be some of the points left but all of them should be inside the figure that is made using the point . 

The gift wrapping algorihtms is very very much similar to the convex 0-point optimisation or the convex Hull problem  .


Brute force for the Convex Hull 
For the N points make n lines and check how many lines intersect with each other , this computation can be done in the form on N*2 where n are the numebr of the points in the Given plane . 

The number of the test that has to be done to check is the O(n) test complexity.

Divide and conquer for the Convex Hull problem  :
Sort operation : sort the points based on the X axis  .

For the Set S divide the set intot eh left and the right half based on the X axis . 

Then compute the Convex hull of the left and the right part of the set individually .
