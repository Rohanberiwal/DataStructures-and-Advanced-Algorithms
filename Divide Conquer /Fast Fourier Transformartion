Divide and Conquer-> FFT Fast fourier transform :
->Polynomial reprtesentations
->FFT , IFFT  and polynomail multiplication 

What is the Polynomial notation ?
A polynomail is a function P(x) such that  :
PCX) = a1 + a2*x  + a3*x2 + a4x3 .... an+1 *(x*n) -> nth order / degree polynomial. 

There is also a vector notation for the Polynomail namely : < a0 , a1,a2,a3...> .Any one dimensional data set is bascially a string of numbers. 
This string of the number can be converted into the vector or can be converted into a polynomial .

Typical operation that are possible in a set of polynomaials: 
1.Evaulation ->A(x) and Xnot for which A(xnot) is defined .This is when we care about X and the position or the value of the polynomial at that position of X . 

Horner Rule for the Defining the i th power of the polynomail  :

A(x)  = anot  + x(a1+x(a2+x(a3....... upto the ith power)))))... ith power .

2.Add polynomail ->C(X) = A(X)  + B(X)->O(N) time complexity .
3.Multiply the poylnomail ->C(X) = A(X)*B(X)->This has the time complexity of n*m where the m and the n are the highet power or the number of term in the poylnomial .

Goal of the Fast fourier transformation is do the multiplication in the Nlogn  time complexity  :

Convulutional of vector  :This is used in the digital image processing and is used in the noise clearing .The example of the convulutional is the blurring of the image in the photoshop .

The time complexity for the polynomail time multiplication and the convulutional is very much same .

Alternate polynomials representation :
A-> cofficeint vector  this is the general represenation and the most basic function  .
B->Generating fucntion : That are bascially the polynomial in generals .
C->Point representation or the Sample represenation .

Mathematically  : sample (xk,yk) for k = 0,1,2...n-1 
		A(xk) = yk x'i are bascially the distinct functions here . 

D->roots The sequence of the root with the defined multiplicity . If the cofficient vector is mentioned and the root is also mentioend then  computing the poylnomial is very tough and hard  .

ALgorithm that we care about : 
1.Evaluation 
2.addition 
3.multiplicaiton 
4.cofficient vector 
5.roots 
6.Samples

What is polynomial interpolation  ?
Polynomial interpolation is a mathematical technique used to construct a polynomial that passes through a given set of data points. The goal is to find a polynomial function that represents the underlying relationship between the independent and dependent variables, allowing for the interpolation (estimation) of values at points not explicitly provided in 
the dataset.
