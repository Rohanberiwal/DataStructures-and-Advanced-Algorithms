- [LinkedList](algorithms/LinkedList.java)
- ...

## Advanced Algorithms

The "advanced-algorithms" directory contains implementations of more complex algorithms, optimization techniques, and advanced data structures.

- [Dynamic Programming](advanced-algorithms/DynamicProgramming.java)
- [Graph Algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm)](advanced-algorithms/GraphAlgorithms.java)
- [Tree Traversal (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)](advanced-algorithms/TreeTraversal.java)
- ...
