# Hash Families

A hash family is a collection of hash functions that can be used for hashing data in various contexts. Each function in a hash family maps inputs to hash values, with the goal of minimizing collisions.

## Characteristics
- **Diversity**: Different hash functions provide different hash values for the same input, reducing the likelihood of collisions.
- **Performance**: Each function is designed to work well for specific types of data or applications.

## Types of Hash Families
1. **Universal Hashing**: A randomized approach to create hash functions that reduce collision probability.
2. **Cryptographic Hash Functions**: Designed to be secure against certain types of attacks.

## Applications
- Data structures like hash tables and hash maps
- Cryptography
- Error detection and correction
