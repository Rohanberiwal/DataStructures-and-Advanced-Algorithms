# Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Key Features
- **Constant Time Complexity**: On average, both insertion and lookup operations have a time complexity of O(1).
- **Collision Handling**: Strategies like chaining and open addressing are used to handle collisions.
  
## Use Cases
- Implementing caches
- Storing user data in databases
- Symbol tables in compilers

## Advantages
- Fast access to data
- Efficient memory usage with dynamic resizing

## Disadvantages
- Performance can degrade with many collisions
- Hash function must be well-designed to minimize collisions
