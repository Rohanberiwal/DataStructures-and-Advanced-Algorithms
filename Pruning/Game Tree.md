# Game Trees

A game tree is a graphical representation of the possible states and moves in a sequential, turn-based game. It provides a structured way to visualize all possible outcomes of a game, allowing players or algorithms to analyze and make decisions based on future possibilities.

## Components of a Game Tree

1. **Nodes**: Nodes represent specific game states or positions.
2. **Edges**: Edges represent possible moves or transitions between game states.
3. **Root Node**: The root node represents the initial state of the game.
4. **Terminal Nodes**: Terminal nodes are states where the game ends, either in a win, loss, or draw.
5. **Branches**: Branches emanating from nodes represent possible moves or decisions that players can make.
