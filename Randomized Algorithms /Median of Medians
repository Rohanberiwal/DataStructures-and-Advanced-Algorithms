"median of medians" is a technique used in the context of deterministic pivot selection strategies, particularly in algorithms like Deterministic Select. 
The goal is to choose a good pivot element that ensures more balanced partitions during the partitioning step of the algorithm.

Here's a breakdown of the concept:

Divide into Groups (Blocks):

The array is divided into groups or blocks, typically of a fixed size. Each block contains a constant number of elements.
Find Medians in Each Block:

For each block, the algorithm finds the median element. This is done by sorting the elements within each block and selecting the middle element.
Median of Block Medians:

The medians found in the previous step are collected to form a new array.
The algorithm then recursively applies the same process to find the median of this new array of block medians.
Choose Pivot:

The final result of the recursion is a single element, which is chosen as the "median of medians" and used as the pivot in the main algorithm.
The idea behind finding the median of medians is to ensure a better pivot selection that avoids worst-case scenarios in certain input distributions.
By selecting a pivot that is more likely to be close to the actual median of the array, the algorithm achieves better performance guarantees.
It's important to note that while finding the median of medians adds some overhead to the algorithm due to the recursive process, it provides a
deterministic approach for pivot selection, which can be beneficial in scenarios where worst-case performance is a concern.
