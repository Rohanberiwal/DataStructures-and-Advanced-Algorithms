Stable sorting 
Sorting is based on multiple creteria .
Assume studnet in  a list in the aplhabetical order and now these are sorted on the basis of the marks . 
The stored order must be maintained in the alphabetical manner meanig the alphabetical ordr has to be the same .

The sucessive sort should not  disturb the action or the sequence of the previous sorts . 

Quicksort is not a stable sorting as the swap operation in the partaioning distrubs the original order .

Merge sort is stable since we merger the order carefully using the recursive merge operation .


Minimize the data movement is anathor factor :
1. Imagine values are hevy cartans 
2. data movement has to be reduced as the operation is very hevy  .

Which is the best sorting algorithm  ?
The best sorting algoirhtm is the heap sort whicb runs in the nlogn the tiem for the heap construcion is the log n and the iteration are n in total.
