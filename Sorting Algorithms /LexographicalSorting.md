# Lexicographical Sorting

Lexicographical sorting is a method of arranging items in a sequence based on the order of their characters in an alphabet or set of symbols. It's similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary.

## Basic Principle

The basic principle of lexicographical sorting is to compare the elements character by character from left to right. The first characters are compared first, and if they are different, the element with the smaller character comes first.

## Comparison

If the first characters of two elements are the same, the comparison moves to the next character. This process continues until the characters at the same position are different, or one of the strings ends.

## Alphabetical Order

In alphabetical order, letters are compared based on their position in the alphabet. For example, 'a' comes before 'b', 'b' comes before 'c', and so on.

## Numeric Order

In numeric order, numbers are compared based on their numerical value. For example, '1' comes before '2', '2' comes before '3', and so on.

## String Length

If all characters in the compared strings are identical up to a certain point, the shorter string is considered lexicographically smaller because it would end sooner in a dictionary.

## Implementation

Lexicographical sorting can be implemented using various algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, merge sort, etc.

## Applications

Lexicographical sorting is widely used in computer science for sorting strings, words, or any data that can be ordered based on character or symbol sequences. It's used in databases, text editors, compilers, and many other applications where sorting is required.
