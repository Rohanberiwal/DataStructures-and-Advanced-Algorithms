### Segment Trees (Interval Trees)

Segment Trees, also known as Interval Trees, are a type of data structure that allows efficient querying and updating of intervals or segments of an array. They are particularly useful when you need to perform range queries (queries that involve a range of elements) or range updates (updating a range of elements) on an array.

#### Structure:
- **Tree Representation**: A Segment Tree is typically represented as a binary tree.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Each leaf node represents a single element of the input array.
- **Internal Nodes**: Each internal node represents an interval or segment of the array.
- **Root Node**: The root node represents the entire array.
- **Range Decomposition**: The array is recursively divided into smaller segments until each segment contains only one element.

#### Operations:
1. **Build Operation**:
   - Constructs the Segment Tree from the input array.
   - It recursively divides the array into segments and computes the values for each segment.

2. **Query Operation**:
   - Retrieves information about a specified range or interval of elements in the array.
   - It traverses the Segment Tree to find the segments that overlap with the specified range and aggregates the values of those segments.

3. **Update Operation**:
   - Modifies the elements within a specified range or interval of the array.
   - It traverses the Segment Tree to update the affected segments accordingly.

#### Features:
- **Efficient Queries and Updates**: Segment Trees provide O(log n) time complexity for both querying and updating, making them suitable for dynamic range queries and updates.
- **Versatility**: They can be used to solve various problems involving range queries and updates, such as finding minimum/maximum values, computing sums/products, and performing range modifications.
- **Space Efficiency**: While Segment Trees require additional space to store the tree structure, they provide efficient query and update operations, which can outweigh the space overhead for large datasets.

#### Applications:
- **Range Minimum/Maximum Query (RMQ)**: Finding the minimum or maximum value in a specified range of elements.
- **Range Sum Query (RSQ)**: Computing the sum of elements in a specified range.
- **Range Update**: Updating the elements within a specified range by a given value.
- **Interval Scheduling**: Finding non-overlapping intervals with maximum or minimum coverage.

#### Implementation:
Segment Trees can be implemented recursively or iteratively, depending on preference and problem requirements. The key components of the implementation include constructing the tree, querying ranges, and updating intervals. Various optimizations can also be applied to improve performance, such as lazy propagation for updates.

Overall, Segment Trees are a powerful data structure that provides efficient solutions to a wide range of problems involving range queries and updates. They are widely used in competitive programming, algorithmic contests, and real-world applications where efficient handling of interval data is required.
