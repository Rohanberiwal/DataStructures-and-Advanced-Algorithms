# Prefix Search Algorithm

## Overview
Prefix search, also known as prefix matching, is a searching technique used to find all words in a given dataset that start with a specific prefix. It is commonly used in applications like autocomplete, spell checkers, and search engines to efficiently retrieve relevant words based on partial input.

## Algorithm Steps
1. **Trie Construction**: The prefix search algorithm typically utilizes a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure to store the dataset of words efficiently.

2. **Insertion**: Insert all words from the dataset into the Trie. Each character of a word is represented as a node in the Trie. The `is_end_of_word` flag is set to True for the last character of each word.

3. **Prefix Search**: To perform a prefix search:
    - Start from the root of the Trie.
    - Traverse down the Trie based on the characters of the prefix.
    - If the traversal reaches the end of the prefix, all words in the subtree rooted at the current node are words with the given prefix.

4. **Retrieval**: Retrieve all words with the given prefix by performing a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node corresponding to the end of the prefix.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: 
    - Constructing the Trie: O(N*M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of words.
    - Searching for words with a prefix: O(K), where K is the length of the prefix.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N*M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of words, for storing the Trie.

## Usage
```python
# Example implementation of Prefix Search using Trie

# Assuming Trie implementation is available
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        # Implementation of Trie insertion
        pass

    def search(self, word):
        # Implementation of Trie search
        pass

    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        # Implementation of Trie starts_with
        pass

    def prefix_search(self, prefix):
        # Implementation of Prefix Search
        pass

# Usage example
trie = Trie()
# Insert words into Trie
words = ["apple", "banana", "application", "book", "cat"]
for word in words:
    trie.insert(word)

# Perform Prefix Search
prefix = "app"
prefix_words = trie.prefix_search(prefix)
print(f"Words with prefix '{prefix}': {prefix_words}")
