## Logic Behind the Code

The provided code implements a method for deleting a node from a binary search tree (BST) while ensuring that the BST properties are maintained, and then splitting the resulting tree into separate trees (a forest) if necessary.

### Deleting a Node from the BST
- The `deleteNode` method takes two parameters: the root of the BST (`root`) and the key of the node to be deleted (`key`).
- The `delete_helper` function recursively traverses the BST to find the node with the specified key.
- When the node is found, it is deleted while maintaining the BST properties.
- There are three cases to consider:
  - Case 1: Node has no children or only one child. In this case, the node is simply removed by adjusting the parent's reference to the node's child.
  - Case 2: Node has two children. In this case, the value of the node is replaced with the minimum value in its right subtree (successor), and then the successor node is recursively deleted from the right subtree.
- The `find_min` function finds the minimum value in a subtree, which is used to find the successor node in Case 2.

### Splitting the BST into Separate Trees (Forest)
- After deleting the node, the `split_forest` function is called to split the BST into separate trees (a forest).
- This function recursively splits the BST at the deleted node, returning a list of trees (the forest).
- The split is performed by disconnecting the deleted node from its parent and returning the left subtree and the right subtree of the deleted node as separate trees.
- If the deleted node has only one child (or no child), it forms a single tree.
- If the deleted node has two children, it forms two separate trees: the left subtree and the right subtree.
- The resulting forest contains all the separate trees obtained after splitting the BST.

By combining these two steps, the provided code allows for the deletion of a node from a BST and the splitting of the resulting tree into separate trees (a forest), thus providing a flexible and comprehensive solution for manipulating BSTs.
