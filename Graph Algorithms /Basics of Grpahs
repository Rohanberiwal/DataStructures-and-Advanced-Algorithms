Graphs Algorithms 

The graphs are the most basic data- structure used  .These has the vertices and edges  .
Vertices :These are also called as the nodes  , these nodes represent the values . 
Egdes : These are used to connect two or more vertices .

Application of Graphs : 
1.These are used in social media application 
2.These are used in the Delivery applications .

Edges in the graph  :
1.Uni - directional 
2.Bi - directional  / Undirectional 

The uni-directional edge cannot move in both directions .
The bi directional or the undirectional edges can move in both edges .

The graph that only uni-directinal edges are callled as directed graphs  .
The graph that has both bi-or the uni directional edges is called as the un-directed graph .

Graphs that has weights  :
1.weighted graphs : That has weights 
2.un - weighted : That has no weights .

The graphs with the weighetd may be directed or maybe undirected  .

Representation of Graph in Memory  :
1.Adjacency List 
2.Implicit Graph -> 2D grpah
3. Edge list 
4. adjancecny matrix .
