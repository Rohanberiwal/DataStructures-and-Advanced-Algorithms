Graphs Algorithms 
The manipulation of the problem in the way that the problem could be solved is called as the Problem Modelling  .
The goal of the problem modelling is to solve the problem in a informative manner  .

graphs are used in the context of the Porblem modelling and is used in the problem solving and the priblem manipulation .
