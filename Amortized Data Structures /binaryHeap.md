# Binary Heap

## Introduction
A binary heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used to implement priority queues  and efficiently support operations like insertion, deletion (extract-min or extract-max), and finding the minimum or maximum element.

## Characteristics
- **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary heap is a complete binary tree where all levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and the nodes are filled from left to right.
- **Heap Property**: In a min-heap, for any given node i, the key of i is less than or equal to the keys of its children. In a max-heap, it's the opposite.
- **Efficient Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the heap.
  - **Extract-Min/Max**: O(log n) time complexity.
  - **Delete**: O(log n) time complexity.
  - **Building Heap**: O(n) time complexity.
- **Space Efficiency**: Binary heaps can be space-efficient compared to other tree-based data structures because they are implemented using an array.

## Structure
Binary heaps are typically implemented using arrays, where the children of the node at index i are stored at indices 2i and 2i+1. This compact representation allows efficient storage and manipulation of the heap.

## Amortized Analysis
While individual operations on binary heaps have worst-case time complexities, the average time complexity over a sequence of operations can be analyzed using amortized analysis. This analysis considers the total time spent on the sequence of operations rather than individual operations.

## Applications
Binary heaps are widely used in various algorithms and applications, including:
- Priority queues in Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and Huffman coding.
- Heap sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- Implementing efficient data structures like priority queues and priority heaps.
- Memory allocation algorithms in operating systems.

## Conclusion
Binary heaps are fundamental data structures that offer efficient operations for maintaining a collection of elements with priority. While they may not always require amortized analysis for time complexity analysis, they play a crucial role in many algorithms and applications due to their simplicity and efficiency.
