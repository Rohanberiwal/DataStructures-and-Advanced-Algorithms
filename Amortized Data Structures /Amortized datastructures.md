# Amortized Data Structures and Amortization
## Introduction
Amortized data structures are those where the average time taken for a sequence of operations is lower than the worst-case time taken for individual operations. The process of amortization involves spreading out the cost of expensive operations over a series of cheaper operations so that the average cost per operation remains low.

## Process of Amortization
1. **Understanding Individual Operations**: In amortized analysis, we examine the time complexity of individual operations within a data structure. Some operations may be expensive, leading to a worst-case scenario, while others may be cheaper.

2. **Identifying the Sequence of Operations**: Instead of focusing on the time complexity of individual operations, we look at the entire sequence of operations performed on the data structure.

3. **Allocating Resources**: In a well-designed amortized data structure, the resources (time, memory, etc.) used by expensive operations are spread out over multiple cheaper operations.

4. **Analysis Over the Sequence**: By analyzing the entire sequence of operations, including both expensive and cheap operations, we calculate the average cost per operation. This average cost is often much lower than the worst-case cost of individual operations.

5. **Maintaining Efficiency**: The goal of amortization is to ensure that even though some operations may be expensive, the overall efficiency of the data structure remains high. This means that the average cost of operations should remain low over time.

## Examples
Amortized data structures are commonly used in algorithm design and data structure implementations to provide efficient performance over a wide range of operations, even if some operations are occasionally expensive. Examples of amortized data structures include dynamic arrays (like Python's list), binary heaps, and hash tables.
