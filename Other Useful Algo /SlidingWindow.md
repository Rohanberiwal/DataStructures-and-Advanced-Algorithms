# Sliding Window Technique

## What is the Sliding Window Technique?

The sliding window technique is a method for solving problems that involve arrays, strings, or other sequential data structures. It involves using a window that slides over the elements of the data structure to efficiently perform a computation or search operation.

## How Does the Sliding Window Technique Work?

The sliding window technique typically involves maintaining a window (a subarray or substring) of fixed or variable size that moves or slides from the beginning to the end of the array or string. At each step, the window is adjusted based on certain criteria, such as the sum, average, or frequency of elements within the window.

Common steps in implementing the sliding window technique include:

1. **Initialization:** Set up initial variables and data structures needed for the sliding window.

2. **Window Expansion:** Increase the size of the window by moving the right boundary (usually by advancing an index or pointer).

3. **Window Contraction:** Decrease the size of the window by moving the left boundary (usually by advancing an index or pointer).

4. **Processing:** Perform computations or checks based on the elements within the current window.

5. **Update Result:** Update the result or store relevant information based on the computations performed.

6. **Repeat:** Continue sliding the window until the end of the array or string is reached.

## Example

Consider the problem of finding the maximum sum of a subarray of length k in an array of integers. This problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique.

```python
def max_subarray_sum(nums, k):
    max_sum = float("-inf")
    window_sum = 0
    left = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        window_sum += nums[right]

        if right - left + 1 == k:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
            window_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1

    return max_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
result = max_subarray_sum(nums, k)
print("Maximum sum of a subarray of length", k, ":", result)  # Output: 16
